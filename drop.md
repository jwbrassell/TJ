5" and up

If you're running more than 4" of suspension lift you've pretty much exceeded the capability of short arms and it's time to move to a mid-arm or long-arm suspension system. However, if you're running over 4" of suspension lift you are probably not a newbie and therefore I'm not even going to address this. 4" of suspension lift is plenty to run 35" tires (especially when using a 1" body lift in addition). The majority of us never run any higher than 4" of suspension lift.
